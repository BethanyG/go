**`exercism/go`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Go *exercises* currently under development or implemented & available for students.

Exercises are grouped into **concept** exercises which teach the [Go syllabus][go-syllabus], and **practice** exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus tree. Concept exercises are constrained to a small set of language or syntax features. Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and _play_.  These two exercise groupings can be found in the track [config.json][config-json], and under the `go/exercises` directory.

Click on that big green button.
You have a chance to add more explanation to your pull request here, then send it.
Looking at the exercism/go repository now instead of your own, you see this.

That inconspicuous orange dot is important!
Hover over it (no, not on this image, on a real page) and you can see it's indicating that a CI build is in progress.
After a few minutes (usually) that dot will turn green indicating that tests passed.
If there's a problem, it comes up red:

<img src="img/mars3.png">

This means you've still got work to do.
Click on "details" to go to the CI build details. Look over the build log for clues.
Usually error messages will be helpful and you can correct the problem.

## Direction

Directions are unlimited.
This code is fresh and evolving.
Explore the existing code and you will see some new directions being tried.
Your fresh ideas and contributions are welcome. :sparkles:
