**`exercism/go`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Go *exercises* currently under development or implemented & available for students.

Exercises are grouped into **concept** exercises which teach the [Go syllabus][go-syllabus], and **practice** exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus tree. Concept exercises are constrained to a small set of language or syntax features. Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and _play_.  These two exercise groupings can be found in the track [config.json][config-json], and under the `go/exercises` directory.
