Exercism exercises in Go

## Issues

We welcome issues filed at https://github.com/exercism/go/issues for problems of any size.
Feel free to report typographical errors or poor wording.
We are most interested in improving the quality of the test suites.
You can greatly help us improve the quality of the exercises by filing reports of invalid solutions that pass tests or of valid solutions that fail tests.

Click on that big green button.

Looking at the exercism/go repository now instead of your own, you see this.

That inconspicuous orange dot is important!
Hover over it (no, not on this image, on a real page) and you can see it's indicating that a CI build is in progress.
After a few minutes (usually) that dot will turn green indicating that tests passed.
If there's a problem, it comes up red:

This means you've still got work to do.
Click on "details" to go to the CI build details. Look over the build log for clues.
Usually error messages will be helpful and you can correct the problem.
